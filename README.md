# tkinter_RunPyFiles
This code uses tkinter to create a GUI from which it allows you to select the files that you need to run.
All the files are ran and their outputs are found in their directories.
 
The batchRunApp.exe is the application created out of the .py file.
Also the installer.msi is provided for win64 bit installation of App and testing the execution process.

Feel free to modify the code and learn more about this function or you can simply contact me>!!

Happy learning!!
